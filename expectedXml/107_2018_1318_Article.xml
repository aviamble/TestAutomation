                <p>To improve the bio-resistance of engineered wood composites products via gluing process, aqueous phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin was modified using nano CuO containing alkane surfactant and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 17-99. The modified PF system was analyzed by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and the mechanical properties of the bonded plywood panels including tensile strength, modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and shear strength under five test conditions were also evaluated. The results indicated that the addition of nano CuO incorporating PVA 17-99 separated the gel point and vitrification point in the curve of tan d, which is related to the delaying of moisture loss in modified PF resin during the curing process. The modification showed adverse effect on tensile strength but only a minimal influence on MOR and MOE. Additionally, PVA 17-99 reduced the water resistance of 2 / 17 cured PF resins. However, with the test conditions of dipping in 100? water for 6 hours, then drying for 20 hours at 63? in air, followed by dipping in 100? water for 4 hours, PVA consolidated the re-curing effect on the PF resin and compensated the strength loss from hydrolysis. Thus, the modified PF system not only guaranteed bio-resistance of glued wood composites via CuO, but also has the potential for developing self-curing wood composites being applied as structural construction materials. Introduction The preservation of wood composites is aimed at the improvement of their durability against bio-attacks. In-process treatments such as mixing wood preservatives with glue or blending it with the wood unit before and/ or together with glue spraying are methods that allow the introduction of wood preservatives during the manufacture process of wood composites products. Several types of wood preservatives were selected to be applied in this way, including copper oxide (Gao and Du 2015), copper ammonium acetate, copper diamine carbonate, micronized copper carbonate (Zhang and Zhang 2009), zinc borate (Breyer et al. 2012), disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT), calcium borate (CaB) (Gao and Du 2013), and isothiazolone etc (Fang et al. 2013). The reported data showed that in-process treatment via normal wood preservatives promoted bio-resistance but also reduced the mechanical and physical properties (Çavdar et al. 2008). Consequently, developing a useful wood adhesive that also functions as a wood preservative would be beneficial. In a previous work it was attempted to introduce nano CuO into phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin system as a wood preservative in bonded plywood panels. Additional analysis of data produced in these studies also showed anti-termite effect on the treated panels (Gao and Du 2015).</p>
