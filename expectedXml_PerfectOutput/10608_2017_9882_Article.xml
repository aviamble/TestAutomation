Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to a 12-week course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD), and whether change in self-beliefs is an indicator of later change in social anxiety symptom severity within treatment. Participants were 77 individuals with SAD who completed measures of maladaptive self-beliefs every two weeks of the treatment protocol and measures of social anxiety each week. Using a dynamic bivariate latent difference score framework, results indicated that maladaptive self-beliefs reduced during CBT for SAD, and that change in maladaptive self-beliefs was a significant predictor of later change in social anxiety symptom severity. Reductions in social anxiety was not a significant predictor of later change</note>
