            <abstract>
                <p>Brevinin-2R (BR-2R), a novel antimicrobial and anti-cancer peptide and two derivatives, BR-C and BR-D, were well designed, synthesized and purified by RP-HPLC (reverse phase high pressure chromatography). Accuracy was confirmed through mass spectrometry. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were carried out to determine cytotoxicity of various concentrations of peptides and their anti-proliferative potential. Results indicate that these compounds have significant anticancer activities in vitro on both MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) and A549 (human lung carcinoma) cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, although showed less cytotoxicity on human red blood cell. Further investigation verified that apoptosis induction, confirmed by Annexin V/PI staining and strong sub G1 cell cycle arrest, was observed in treated MCF-7 and A549 cells. Induction of apoptosis and anti-proliferating activity were closely associated with augmentation of caspase-3/7 activity, surging the apoptotic cells with no variation on caspase-8 activity. The growth inhibition of BR-2R was exceedingly stronger than two derivatives; on the other hand, MCF-7 was more susceptible to treatment than A549. Findings prominently suggested development of Brevinin-2R and derivatives as novel promising compounds for cancer therapy, which may conquer drug resistance.</p>
