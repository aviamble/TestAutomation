In this study we presented Confirmatory Factor Analysis and the the validation studies of the The Community Integration Scale of Adults with Psychiatric Disorders (CIS-APP) a new self-report scale developed to assess community integration in several. The main goal of the current study is to explore the psychometric properties of CIS-APP in a sample of 411 participants with and without a psychiatric illness, with ages between 19 and 91 years old, living in the Azores Islands, Portugal. Since this scale was developed for the Portuguese population, it is noteworthy that Portuguese is the fourth most spoken language in the world, with more than 240 million native speakers, thus allowing professional spread all across the globe to use this assessment tool (Ethnologue, 2014).</p>
