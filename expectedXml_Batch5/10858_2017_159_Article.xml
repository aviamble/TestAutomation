                <p>The non structural protein 5A (NS5A) regulates the replication of the hepatitis C viral RNA through a direct molecular interaction of its domain 2 (NS5A-D2) with the RNA dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. Because of conflicting data in the literature, we study here this molecular interaction using fluorinated versions of the NS5A-D2 protein derived from the JFH1 Hepatitis C Virus strain. Two methods to prepare fluorine-labelled NS5A-D2 involving the biosynthetic incorporation of a 19 F-tryptophan using 5-fluoroindole and the posttranslational introduction of fluorine by chemical conjugation of 2-iodo-N-(trifluoromethyl)acetamide with the NS5A-D2 cysteine side chains are presented. The dissociation constants (K D) between NS5A-D2 and NS5B obtained with these two methods are in good agreement, and yield values comparable to those derived previously from a surface plasmon resonance study. We compare benefits and limitations of both labeling methods to study the interaction between an intrinsically disordered protein and a large molecular target by 19 F NMR. Keywords 19 F NMR spectroscopy; 19 F protein labelling; HCV NS5A-D2; HCV NS5B; Protein-protein interaction. Introduction NMR spectroscopy is ideally suited to measure the interaction between (bio)molecules in solution. 1 Besides evidencing a molecular interaction, it can detail the interaction sites on both partners, but equally the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the complex. 2–4 The dissociation constant K D can thereby be deduced from a titration experiment, whereby the resonance shift or broadening is observed as a function of the added concentration of the partner. 4 A prerequisite for such studies, though, is the capacity at all to observe the NMR spectrum. Whereas size limits of the molecules that can be studied have been alleviated by recent progress in deuteration schemes combined with enhanced NMR methods, 5,6 the exchange rate also has a significant impact on the spectral quality. For many biological systems with K D values in the 1-100µM range, exchange between the free and bound states on a time scale comparable to the frequency difference leads to excessive line broadening, and one loses the resonances of interest sometimes as early as the first titration points. 7 Such was the case when we studied the molecular interaction between the RNA dependent RNA polymerase NS5B of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) with its NS5A protein, whereby the interaction site on the latter is localized in its D2 domain. 8 In this mainly intrinsically disordered domain, 9 we recently identified a short structural motif, that we called the PW-turn. 10 Conserved across all HCV genotypes, it seems essential for HCV RNA replication. NS5A-D2 and NS5B are linked to the host protein Cyclophilin A (CypA), as resistance mutations appear in these two viral proteins under low doses of Cyclosporine A (CsA), the well-known CypA inhibitor with anti-HCV properties 11,12. NS5B and CypA share a common binding site on NS5A-D2 located in the region 306-323 that includes this 310 P 312 W turn. 8,13,14 Traditional 1 H, 15 N solution state NMR proved limited to determine the affinity of the interaction between NS5B and NS5A-D2 because of rapid spectrum broadening when NS5B was added. As this prevented a titration study, we used surface plasmon resonance to deduce a K D value of 21µM. 8 Recently, however, another study suggested nanomolar affinity for the</p>
