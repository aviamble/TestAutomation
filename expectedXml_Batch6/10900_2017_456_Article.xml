                <p>This study includes a comparison analysis of how community resilience and its influence factor of community attachment were changed before and after the closing of the hospital in the rural community. In order to analyze the influence factors of healthcare and medical vulnerability on community resilience, as well as the mean difference from before and after the closing of the hospital, this study conducted matching sample t-test, hierarchical regression analysis, difference in differences (DID) analysis. The results indicate that community attachment consists of such factors as closeness, preference, affective bond, and identity, and they showed significance in confidence. It showed that resilience and community attachment are lower after closing than before closing. Moreover, as a result of DID analysis where the variation of community attachment affects community resilience, closeness together with closeness had an influence on the community resilience. It needs to expand public projects to improve the settlement environment of the basic local government, and in particular, it should consider various support measures to overcome vulnerabilities in 2 the healthcare and medical sector.</p>
